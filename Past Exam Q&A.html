				<h2 style="color: #f79f9f;">The Dead</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<h3>
						Please specify the irony in Gabriel’s speech.
					</h3>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					In Gabriel’s speech, he lamented that, in the present age, the hospitality like that of the Morkan family is undervalued. However, he insisted that people must not linger on the past, but accept the present. Gabriel’s words contradicted.
					In the speech, he bemoaned the shortcomings of “the new generation”.
					<br></br>
					<i>I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day.</i>
					<br></br>
					On the other hand, he urged his audience to cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die. 
					Gabriel ultimately encourages a tribute to the past, of hospitality, that lives on in the present party. His later thoughts reveal this his attachment to the past when he envisions snow as “general all over Ireland.”

				<h2 style="color: #f79f9f;">A Room of One's Own</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<h3>
						Please explain the relationship between the speaker and Virginia Woolf and the anxiety towards inherited wealth.
						
					</h3>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					The narrator in A Room of One’s Own is said to be left with a legacy of 500 pounds per year from her deceased aunt. Her situation is much similar to that of Virginia Woolf, who was also bequeathed with a legacy of 2500 pounds annually on the death of her paternal aunt. Yet while most people may feel grateful upon receiving such an inheritance, Woolf was not entirely at ease with it. She mentioned her willingness to give her share to her brother in her letter, who only received 100 pounds. She refers to this distribution of inheritance as “very disappointing”, which might partly result from a sense of guilt triggered by her receiving a bigger share of inheritance among siblings. 
					<br><br>
					Woolf's anxiety towards money is also obvious in her diary, as she referred to herself as “one of those who are hampered by the psychological hindrance of owning capital”. This uneasiness towards inheritance is evident in an earlier draft: “Society gives me luncheon, clothes & a house. In exchange for a certain number of pieces of paper, which were given me for no very good reason, by an Aunt”. The tone in this very sentence suggests that the speaker does not think that she deserves this sum, yet since she bears her aunt’s name, she still owns it. Considering the similarity in situation between the speaker and Woolf, this could represent Woolf’s opinion towards her inheritance in the real world. Getting what one does not deserve is probably one of the reasons contributing to Woolf’s anxiety towards capital, and from here one can see how the speaker in A Room of One’s Own might be reflecting Woolf herself.

				<h2 style="color: #f79f9f;">The Waste Land</h2>
				<blockquote>
					<h3>
						Describe "The Waste Land" by T.S Eliot as a modern poem.
					</h3>
				</blockquote>
				<p>
					"The Waste Land" is a modern poem and also a Modernist one. While Modernism was a distinct literary movement, of which T.S. Eliot was one of the leading figures, the word "modern" appears at first sight to refer to nothing but the date of composition. It is possible to describe "The Waste Land" as a modern poem simply because it was written in the twentieth century. It has, however, other attributes of modernity which overlap with Modernism but may, at any rate, be described as "modern" as well as being "Modernist."
					<br></br>
					"The Waste Land" is written, like the majority of modern poetry, in free verse. Although it is a long poem, and has some points in common with epic, it is clearly not an epic poem in the same sense as Paradise Lost or even the Idylls of the King. It has no hero and no linear narrative. The poem is also highly allusive, and its allusions cover a very wide range, from classical and medieval literature to nursery rhymes.
					<br></br>
					The above stylistic points are common to modernity and literary Modernism, but Modernism has a conflicted relationship with modernity, nowhere more so than in "The Waste Land." There are glancing references to aristocrats and heroes in the poem, but there are just as many allusions to more modern figures, "Mr. Eugenides, the Smyrna merchant," and the silk-hatted "Bradford millionaire." Most of all there are the crowds swarming over London Bridge. Eliot regards modernity as the age of the common man but, being an elitist, he does not much like this. He therefore uses a highly obscure and allusive Modernist style as a form of resistance to modernity; he writes about the rise of the common man in a way that no common man could understand.
